Hello, this is Jean-Michaël. I am a freelance researcher, interested in art, code, computer music and interactive show control.
I spend my free time on the [ossia](https://ossia.io) software ecosystem for intermedia creation. I also take part to the [intermedia.tools](https://intermedia.tools) initiative.

I did my engineering curriculum and my doctorate, with an inclination towards computer science and multimedia technologies, 
at the [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://www.enseirb-matmeca.fr) and the [Université de Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr).

You can [check out my thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01947309) and hopefully tell me if you see any improvement that could be made :-)

I play guitar and dabble in music in general, love pen & paper RPGs and board games, enjoy cooking, taking night strolls in random foreign cities, and my sweet kitten [Shashimi](assets/img/shashimi.jpg).

# Work
I've worked, in no particular order: 
 - On interactive installations at [Blue Yeti](http://www.blueyeti.fr/home/) who employed me during my thesis. Check out the [Carrousel Musical](https://www.youtube.com/embed/AXeYH8W43qE)! 
  Fun fact: at 0:53 you can see my desktop computer. Producing useful code on it when the merry-go-round was spinning all day long was an interesting challenge.
 - On [Qt](https://qt.io), [Kuesa](https://www.kdab.com/kuesa), Qt3D and various embedded devices at [KDAB](https://kdab.com).
 - On various projects for the [SCRIME](https://scrime.u-bordeaux.fr/) and the [Université de Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr) - in particular an [editor](https://github.com/scrime-u-bordeaux/segment-editor) for [SEGMent²](https://scrime.u-bordeaux.fr/Recherche/Projets3/SEGMent2-Study-and-Education-Game-Maker) as well as various implementations of improvisation algorithms and a website [to help COVID-19 research](https://touxpourlascience.labri.fr).
 - On instruments for teaching music to young children at [Rock & Chansons](https://www.lesboiteselectriques.com): Les Boites Électriques.

My main tools are recent dialects of C++, Qt, Boost, and CMake. 
I mostly do my work under Linux systems and am a strong proponent of free, libre and open-source software.
I license my own work under [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) as far as a I can.

I have experience with a fair amount of programming language paradigms and favor the type-level computations that C++ enables most; I ran a short-lived user group in Bordeaux in 2019.
I sometimes use QML for non-desktop user interfaces and have a long love & hate relationship with OCaml.

I am interested in all the languages and tools geared towards creative coding: 
OpenFrameworks, Faust, PureData, OpenMusic, Processing, Cinder, Max/MSP, ChucK...

Slow software has a tendency to make my hands shake -- I prefer (Lua)LaTeX to web technologies.
