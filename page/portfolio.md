## Software

### Interactive media
- [ossia](https://ossia.io) is the main thing I spend my time on. It is a software ecosystem for creating interactive and intermedia art. The main software are [ossia score](https://github.com/OSSIA/score), an intermedia sequencer, and [libossia](https://github.com/OSSIA/libossia), a library to allow interoperability between most creative coding environments such as Processing, Max/MSP, PureData...

- [oscour](https://github.com/jcelerier/oscour) is a C++ library that tries to explore the abilities 
of C++17 with regards to the implementation of the OSC network protocol.

- [rtmidi17](https://github.com/jcelerier/RtMidi17) is a MIDI library which is a fork & merge of two libraries: [RtMidi](https://github.com/theSTK/RtMidi) by Gary Scavone (& others) and [ModernMIDI](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/ModernMIDI) by Dimitri Diakopoulos (& others).
It features reduced memory allocations, header-only mode, more protocols (UWP-MIDI on Windows, Jack on Windows & macOS), and partial notification of new device connection.

- [libisf](https://github.com/jcelerier/libisf) is a work-in-progress library for [Interactive Shader Format](https://editor.isf.video) support in C++. Most of it has been rewritten for the sake of [ossia score](https://github.com/OSSIA/score) - it should be updated again to support the Qt RHI.

- [phidgetspp](https://github.com/jcelerier/phidgetspp) wraps the [Phidgets](https://www.phidgets.com) C89 API into a nicer modern C++ API.

### Development & tooling
- [cninja](https://github.com/jcelerier/cninja) - a configuration manager for CMake.

- [qml-creative-controls](https://github.com/jcelerier/qml-creative-controls) - a library of controls for creative coding in Qt Quick. Made in collaboration with Akané.

- [dynalizer](https://github.com/jcelerier/dynalizer) - a libclang-based generator of DLL wrapper for C headers, to allow for instance to dynamically load libraries such as PortAudio or OpenSSL easily. [dynalized](https://github.com/jcelerier/dynalized) contains examples of wrapped libraries.

- [napd](https://github.com/jcelerier/napd) - a systemd service to control nap on Linux systems, like `powernap` on macOS. Mainly used to put my NAS to sleep when it is not used and wake it up automatically when I access it. 

### Max/MSP externals
- [by.pixie](https://github.com/jcelerier/by.pixie) - an ENTTEC Pixie Driver external for Max/MSP.

- [jit.realsense](https://github.com/blueyeti/jit.realsense) - an external to use the Intel RealSense cameras with Max/MSP.
  
### Older & educational projects

- [libwatermark](https://github.com/jcelerier/libwatermark) - a set of audio filters to watermark audio files, made with friends for a school project.
  
- [3D drums](https://github.com/jcelerier/per-instrument-3D) - a school project to play virtual drums rendered through a Pepper's Ghost-like illusion, made with friends for a school project under the supervision of [Jospeh Larralde](https://www.ircam.fr/person/joseph-larralde).

- [Guitar Tutor](https://github.com/jcelerier/GuitarTutor) - a software for teaching guitar songs easily, made with friends for a school project.
  
- [dpetri](https://github.com/jcelerier/dpetri) - a Petri net execution simulator.
  
- [Udoo Player](https://github.com/jcelerier/UdooPlayer) - a distributed music loop player for Udoo boards.


## Research

You can find my papers [at this link](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=v1_52IMAAAAJ). 
I do my best to publish everything in open-access. 

## Teaching
- [C++ Teaching Manifesto](https://github.com/jcelerier/cpp-teaching-manifesto) - C++ is a language that is badly taught. I'm trying to do my part to fix that.

- I regularly mentor groups of students and apprentices who work on various aspects of ossia, they put their work here: [github.com/iscore-pfa](https://github.com/iscore-pfa), and [github.com/iscore-3d-scenery](https://github.com/iscore-3d-scenery).

- I sometimes give interactive music classes - the exercices & other useful files are on Gitlab: [https://gitlab.com/jcelerier](https://gitlab.com/jcelerier).

- I often have students working on robot choreographies with the [Metabots](http://www.metabot.fr):

## Music
I don't play much music these days but we're trying to do fun things with Julien in [Phonema](https://phonemaband.bandcamp.com), an experimental prog metal band.
I used to be in a nü-metal band - [Static Fist](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5wan1). 

I also worked on various soundtracks and background musics for museums during my time at Blue Yeti, for instance for the [Futuroscope](https://www.futuroscope.com/fr/) and 
the [Musée National de la Marine](http://www.musee-marine.fr/content/rochefort-musee-de-la-marine) in Rochefort. 

I also took part in the composition process for the Carrousel Musical, and pressed the "Play" button for its inauguration, which had a very high stress/duration ratio:

## Other
I've also been involved in ports of large codebases to CMake: [Jamoma](http://jamoma.org/) and [Qt](https://qt.io).
